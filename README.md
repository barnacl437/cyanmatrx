# cyanmatrx

cool and clean (i guess) firefox theme. 

took lots of codes from [alan-ar1's greenyfox](https://github.com/alan-ar1/greenyfox) and made it more readable (and usable imo).

it's just cyan monospace texts and deep dark background around in my head. feel free to *get involved*. Expect future updates as i'm still trying to mess around with this.


Follow the generic how to install [here](https://github.com/FirefoxCSS-Store/FirefoxCSS-Store.github.io).
by default it will use Intel One Mono and system default monospace font if not presented. Install the font at this [Intel official repo](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono).

tip: you can make the tab minimum visible text width wider and easier to read by setting a higher number for `browser.tabs.tabMinWidth` in <a href="about:config">`about:config`</a>. I will figure out a way to add it right into my css file.

bored reading? yeah i ran outta words too, some prtscn-s below:
